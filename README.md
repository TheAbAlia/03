Pfizer and BioNTech Vaccine Tweets

Analysis aim is to answer three questions:

- What is the dominant sentiment of Pfizer vaccine-related tweets?

- Is there any correlation between sentiment and (date) (location) (user)?

Since we are preforming on the CPU, we use Vader to provide the sentiments, this is **not** the best practice since transformers exists. To be updated later.

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion.
